# Project 1: Karmaconomy

### By Samantha Diamond

## How Karmaconomy Works

Karmaconomy is about sharing goods and helping others through Karma 'transactions'. At Karmaconomy we are passionate about making the world a better place. Through sharing goods and services, we as a society can reduce consumption and help save our precious planet. Karmaconomy's sharing model brings people together and helps build happier and more connected communities.

When you sign up to Karmaconomy you will automatically receive 10 karma to get started. You can acquire and give karma through deeds. To earn karma, find a deed that you would like to perform in the deeds list and click 'accept'. Once the deed is completed the karma will be transferred to you. If you would like to create a deed, click 'new deed' in the navigation bar and complete the form. It is up to you to decide the karma value of the deed. You must inform Karmaconomy when the deed is completed.
